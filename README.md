# Challenge-1 - Refactoring Code

## Description 
Refactored esixting code for a website. The reason behind this was to make the website more accessible. 

Code previously had many DIV tags inputted, so semantic elements were used to replace this tag. Some class attributes were also changed to ID's. ALT attribute was also added within img tags. Also added decription to title element within head of HTML file. 

Making a website more accessible ensures people with disabilities using assistive technology such as video screen readers are able to access website. 

Making a website accessible is also good for other reasons such as allowing a website to be better positioned for search engine optimisation.
